    content: `i have only seen persian sadness for so long
that i forgot the scent of persian joy the warm, bitter smell of the sun a group dance in the park summer sweat
the smile of a hundred people as they dance shoulder to shoulder moving their bodies these bodies, free
miniskirts and headscarves and booty shorts and long jeans sharing glances sharing food
i don't know you but have some of my cotlet and khiar shur with sabzi come sit on my mat 
do you want some chai?
i hear my mother tongue all around me my heart defrosts as i watch
the two shy kids take each other by hand after much contemplation and run to the dance floor
all persians need is each other and a beat swaying together hands raised jumping
Singing
we are here so far from home but we are here, together
watch us turn bayfront park into meydane azadi into a cousin's cousin's wedding into a family gathering
watch us kiss each other's cheeks and caress each other's faces
watch us sing and dance and laugh into the sunset 
we are not cosplaying joy we are living it
our country is on fire but we hold hands and dance around it because sometimes
you have to put out the flames by laughing in its face we placed our water buckets down and danced we loved we sang
persian joy is always in the face of a beatdown in the face of a violation oppression pain
but it is still persian joy
if we are only happy when the times are good then we'll never be happy at all
take my hands, farnoush, ghazal, keyvan, ali take my hands dear precious persian people that i've never even met before take my hands and lets dance lets shake our bodies to the beat of all these memories that weigh so heavy lets dance in hopes of going home to a free iran lets dance for each other because we have each other
lets dance so when we're tired
we can gladly accept the warm seat and chai that's offered to us

these cherry blossoms will be resting by the end of the week
her eyes are closed as the sun shines so she can't quite hear me and that's my cue
i watch her as pink petals fall around her hair flowing gently like willow tree branches under the nectarine spring sun her eyelids flutter open
and the wave of her eyelashes like a gentle nod
"let's meet again"
she tells me
"before the flowers wither"
