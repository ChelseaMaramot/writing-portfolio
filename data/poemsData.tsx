    content: `she pulls me in so close her ear cold on my cheek rocking me from side to side
though i'm not a baby in a mother's arms i am a warrior saying my final goodbyes melting away the layers adulthood has formed becoming a child again as you tell me to have a safe flight
and when i picture myself on a plane i also picture myself coming back to you i'll leave to grow into someone who is worthy of your love
and i'll return to give it all back to you
but for now it'll just be me myself and i
carry your love on my back like a turtle make it my home
crawl in no matter where i am the desert winds could dry me i could drown in an ocean the snow could freeze me i could suffocate under the rain but this shell will always stay the same the parts of me that don't change are the pieces of yourself that you gave to me
i wove them into an umbrella the hood of a sweater two hands over a head
but still for now it'll just be me myself and i
as i learn to love myself in your absence space i thought i wanted not sure what i needed
retract the hand i used to reach out to you i'm a warrior now
fighting all these battles on my own but you'll always be there
the edges of this body that you sanded
'till it sparked
'till it stabbed
are the parts that save me when i'm under attack
so you hug me and tell me to come back but before i knew what home was i already knew it would call me back to itself when i was gone too long
and i wouldn't even wait for that call to come back
this body is a boomerang
can throw me far but i'll always return hang my head low and face it alone until i finally come back to you

    content: `I hate the phrase “you’re so lucky “
as if you didn't grit your teeth and carry so much on your back
to get here as if it wasn't hitting the soil
a hundred times over
and over and over
that got you what you wanted that helped your tree bear fruits
your blood sweat tears
the water
the fire of your passion the sun
and when the wind got knocked out of you, you fed your tree carbon dioxide every breath out was to
create the air you breathe in for your own lungs
'youre so lucky'
and yeah the stars did align but they wouldnt have if you didnt rotate the entire universe on your own
'youre so lucky' and i know you're not
 you're so deserving you deserve it you worked for it prayed and begged for it
and even if it seems like it was handed to you dont forget everything that came before take it and know this wasnt luck
this was the smallest thing the universe could do for you
in return for you lighting all the stars in the sky ablaze
with your passion

    content: `i have only seen persian sadness for so long
that i forgot the scent of persian joy the warm, bitter smell of the sun a group dance in the park summer sweat
the smile of a hundred people as they dance shoulder to shoulder moving their bodies these bodies, free
miniskirts and headscarves and booty shorts and long jeans sharing glances sharing food
i don't know you but have some of my cotlet and khiar shur with sabzi come sit on my mat 
do you want some chai?
i hear my mother tongue all around me my heart defrosts as i watch
the two shy kids take each other by hand after much contemplation and run to the dance floor
all persians need is each other and a beat swaying together hands raised jumping
Singing
we are here so far from home but we are here, together
watch us turn bayfront park into meydane azadi into a cousin's cousin's wedding into a family gathering
watch us kiss each other's cheeks and caress each other's faces
watch us sing and dance and laugh into the sunset 
we are not cosplaying joy we are living it
our country is on fire but we hold hands and dance around it because sometimes
you have to put out the flames by laughing in its face we placed our water buckets down and danced we loved we sang
persian joy is always in the face of a beatdown in the face of a violation oppression pain
but it is still persian joy
if we are only happy when the times are good then we'll never be happy at all
take my hands, farnoush, ghazal, keyvan, ali take my hands dear precious persian people that i've never even met before take my hands and lets dance lets shake our bodies to the beat of all these memories that weigh so heavy lets dance in hopes of going home to a free iran lets dance for each other because we have each other
lets dance so when we're tired
we can gladly accept the warm seat and chai that's offered to us

    content: `Can we meet again before the flowers wither?
these cherry blossoms will be resting by the end of the week
her eyes are closed as the sun shines so she can't quite hear me and that's my cue
i watch her as pink petals fall around her hair flowing gently like willow tree branches under the nectarine spring sun her eyelids flutter open
and the wave of her eyelashes like a gentle nod
"let's meet again"
she tells me
"before the flowers wither"
